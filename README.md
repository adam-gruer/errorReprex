# errorReprex
reproducible example of an R package install error

the command ```R CMD INSTALL errorReprex``` fails in the error branch. Error message displayed below.
In the `no_error` branch there is no failure.  The only difference between the two branches is the presence of
`import(emayili)` in the `NAMESPACE` file in the error branch.

Also neither branch fails if the package version of emayili is <= 0.4.15

Steps to reproduce

git clone
